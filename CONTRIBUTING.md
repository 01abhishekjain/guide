## Installations

Though it's not required, you may install the `docute-cli` package. You can do so by running the following command:
    npm i -g docute-cli

After that, you can simply run `docute ./guide` to run a server at `localhost:8080`.

Alternatively, you can simply open up the index.html file and run it through there.

## Adding Pages

For now, you should refer to the [docute documentation](https://docute.js.org/#/home) in order to figure out how to add/edit existing pages. Or you can just copt/paste/modify some of the existing code in the `main.js` file. Honestly, this is just here as a placeholder; I'll edit it again later.
